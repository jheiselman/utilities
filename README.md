# utilities
Various utilities that I've used. Nothing special and maybe not useful to most other people.

These were originally written to be able to run on my router (OpenWRT), but they have since gotten a little complex for the basic ash shell there. These now require a fairly feature rich bash shell and I am using them on my raspberry pi.
